# Counter-Strike 1.6 ReGameDLL combined with Zombie Plague Mod

Using Zombie Plague 5.0.8 with AMXX 1.8.2 and ReGameDLL installed will lead to game crashes when loading maps.
To resolve this issue, update the AMXX version to 1.10. Once the AMXX version is updated, the game should no longer crash when loading maps.

Compactible versions:
- [AMXX 1.10]
    [Base Pack]([URL](https://www.amxmodx.org/amxxdrop/1.10/amxmodx-1.10.0-git5217-base-windows.zip))
    [Counter-Strike Addon](https://www.amxmodx.org/amxxdrop/1.10/amxmodx-1.10.0-git5217-cstrike-windows.zip)
- Zombie Plague 5.0.8
- ReGameDLL 5.22.0.593

Additional Componets that I use: 
- ReAPI 5.22.0.254
- Metamod-R 1.21p38
