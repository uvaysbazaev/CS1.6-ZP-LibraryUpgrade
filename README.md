# Counter-Strike 1.6 ReGameDLL combined Zombie Plague Mod

Zombie Plague 5.0.8 using AMXX 1.8.2 will crash the game when ReGameDLL is installed

You need to change the version of AMXX. I changed the version to 1.10 and it worked, game stopped to crash when starting a map.

Compactible versions:
- AMXX 1.10
- Zombie Plague 5.0.8
- ReGameDLL 5.22.0.593

Additional: 
- ReAPI 5.22.0.254
- Metamod-R 1.21p38
